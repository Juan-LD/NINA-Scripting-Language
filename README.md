# NINA-Scripting-Language

---

### Small language that comunicates with the libraries in Living Delusion.

So, this isnt really the finished version by any means and it also only works on Linux has of right now lol.

Im going to add more "moduels" to it soon and actually make this README viable to read if you want to explore this scripting language.
Until then all you get is this :P.

#### Whats for later?

Heres a tiny sneak peek on what im planning to add later
  - 6 new moduels (depends on how many sub-libraries Living Delusion has)
  - Short Sintax
  - NINA needed files have a directory for themselfs

Heres a tiny example i have in mind of how "short sintax" would work:
Instead of
```
ChangeTerminalColor(3)
```
We do
```
CLR 3
```
I know, i know the code becomes more unreadable but i REALLY dont want to type out the full function :P

> These are just tiny things on my mind
  , you never know if its really coming or not...
